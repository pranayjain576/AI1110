## Instructions to compile/execute the source code

For the execution of the code, you need to create a .access and a .config file containing one address in each line of the access file(Ensure that the address if of proper hex representation). Replace the files (.access and .config) in the code to your file name. In the config file mention the configurations properly.
The output will be Hit/Miss for every instruction.

The instruction to run and compile the code using GNU (gcc) compiler is: 

```bash
gcc Source.c
```
bash
./a.out
